# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

# Introduction
This repository has been created to document and demonstrate the process of __Requirement Analysis__ in the context of software development. It serves as a structured guild for understanding how requirements are gathered, analyzed, modeled, and validated before the design and implementation phases begin.

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate how effective requirement analysis forms the foundation of a successful software project. By using a practical **Booking Management System** as a case study, the repository highlights key concepts, methodologies, and deliverables associated with this critical stage of the __Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

Within this repository, you will find detailed explanations of the different stages and activities involved in requirement analysis, including requrement gathering, documentations, and validation. It also explores the classification of requirements, and provides a visual representation through use case diagrams, and concludes with examples well-defined acceptance criteria.

This resource is intended for **students, software engineers, and analysts** who seek to strengthen their understanding of requirement engineering practices and learn how to translate stakeholder needs into actionable software specifications.
